JVM implementation of the consumer driven contract library [pact](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification).

From the [Ruby Pact website](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact):

> Define a pact between service consumers and providers, enabling "consumer driven contract" testing.
>
>Pact provides an RSpec DSL for service consumers to define the HTTP requests they will make to a service provider and the HTTP responses they expect back. 
>These expectations are used in the consumers specs to provide a mock service provider. The interactions are recorded, and played back in the service provider 
>specs to ensure the service provider actually does provide the response the consumer expects.
>
>This allows testing of both sides of an integration point using fast unit tests.
>
>This gem is inspired by the concept of "Consumer driven contracts". See http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html for more information.

## Service Consumers

Pact-JVM has a number of ways you can write your service consumer tests.

### I Use Scala

You want to look at: [scala-pact](https://github.com/ITV/scala-pact) or [specs2](consumer/specs2)

### I Use Java

You want to look at: [junit](consumer/junit) for JUnit 4 tests and
[junit5](consumer/junit5) for JUnit 5 tests. Also, if you are using Java 8, there is [an
updated DSL for consumer tests](consumer/java8).

### I Use Groovy or Grails

You want to look at: [groovy](consumer/groovy) or [junit](consumer/junit)

### (Use Clojure I)

Clojure can call out to Java, so have a look at [junit](consumer/junit). For an example
look at [example_clojure_consumer_pact_test.clj](consumer/junit/src/test/clojure/au/com/dius/pact/consumer/example_clojure_consumer_pact_test.clj).

### I Use some other jvm language or test framework

You want to look at: [Consumer](consumer/consumer)

### My Consumer interacts with a Message Queue

As part of the V3 pact specification, we have defined a new pact file for interactions with message queues. For an
  implementation of a Groovy consumer test with a message pact, have a look at [PactMessageBuilderSpec.groovy](consumer/groovy/src/test/groovy/au/com/dius/pact/consumer/groovy/messaging/PactMessageBuilderSpec.groovy).

## Service Providers

Once you have run your consumer tests, you will have generated some Pact files. You can then verify your service providers
with these files.

### I am writing a provider and want to ...

#### verify pacts with SBT

You want to look at: [scala-pact](https://github.com/ITV/scala-pact)

#### verify pacts with Gradle

You want to look at: [pact gradle plugin](provider/gradle)

#### verify pacts with Maven

You want to look at: [pact maven plugin](provider/maven)

#### verify pacts with JUnit tests

You want to look at: [junit provider support](provider/junit) for JUnit 4 tests and 
 [junit5](provider/junit5) for JUnit 5 tests

#### verify pacts with Leiningen

You want to look at: [pact leiningen plugin](provider/lein)

#### verify pacts with Specs2

Have a look at [specs2](provider/specs2)

#### verify pacts with a Spring MVC project

Have a look at [spring](provider/spring) or [Spring MVC Pact Test Runner](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact-jvm-provider-spring-mvc) (Not maintained).

#### I want to verify pacts but don't want to use sbt or gradle or leiningen

You want to look at: [provider](provider/provider)

#### verify interactions with a message queue

As part of the V3 pact specification, we have defined a new pact file for interactions with message queues. The Gradle
pact plugin supports a mechanism where you can verify V3 message pacts, have a look at [pact gradle plugin](provider/gradle#verifying-a-message-provider).
The JUnit pact library also supports verification of V3 message pacts, have a look at [junit](provider/junit#verifying-a-message-provider).

### I Use Ruby or Go or something else
The pact-jvm libraries are pure jvm technologies and do not have any native dependencies.

However if you have a ruby provider, the json produced by this library is compatible with the ruby pact library.
You'll want to look at: [Ruby Pact](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact).

For .Net, there is [Pact-net](https://github.com/SEEK-Jobs/pact-net).

For JS, there is [Pact-JS](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js).

For Go, there is [Pact-go](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go).

Have a look at [implementations in other languages](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact/wiki#implementations-in-other-languages).

### I Use something completely different

There's a limit to how much we can help, however check out [pact-jvm-server](pact-jvm-server)

## How do I transport my pacts from consumers to providers?

You want to look at:
[Pact Broker](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker)

Which is a project that aims at providing tooling to coordinate pact generation and delivery between projects.

## I want to contribute

[Documentation for contributors is on the wiki](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/wiki/How-to-contribute-to-Pact-JVM).
